    <h2>What is Computer Science</h2>
    <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems. It is a broad field which includes everything from the algorithms that make up software to how software interacts with hardware to how well software is developed and designed. Computer
        scientists use various mathematical algorithms, coding procedures, and their expert programming skills to study computer processes and develop new software and systems.</p>



    <h2>Some Computer Science Job</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>AI Engineer: Artificial intelligence engineers create computer systems that can do the tasks humans would otherwise do.</li>
        <li>Information security analyst: This position requires you to ensure computer network security.</li>
        <li>IT project manager: A project manager leads a team of computer professionals in projects from conception to completion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History of Computer Science</h2>
    <p>The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication
        and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment</p>
