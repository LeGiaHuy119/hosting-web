    <h2>What is CSS and ECMAScript</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>ECMAScript (ES) is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. It is best known as a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers. ECMAScript is commonly
        used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for server-side applications and services using runtime environments - Node.js,deno and bun.</p>
